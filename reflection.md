- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Inheritance is a powerful way to make code more organized and efficient. By creating a Building superclass with shared properties like name, address, and nFloors, I could easily reuse these attributes in subclasses like House, Library, and Cafe. This really cut down on repetitive code and kept things streamlined.

Overall, inheritance made it much easier to set up the subclasses, and adding specific methods like moveIn for House or addTitle for Library went smoothly. The main challenge was writing some if statement in cafe and understanding hashtable.

I will start earlier to think about the assignment in future to avoid using extension, also go to office hours and tutoring more oftenly. This time, collaborating with my classmate to do troubleshooting was really helpful.
